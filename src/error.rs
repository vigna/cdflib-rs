//! Errors shared across distributions.
//!
//! Each distribution module declares its own narrow error enum (so `match`
//! arms stay meaningful). The enums for distributions whose inverse routines
//! go through the reverse-communication root-finder carry a [`SolverError`]
//! variant; distributions that are closed-form everywhere (e.g. [`Normal`])
//! do not. A few distributions whose kernels bubble up their own structured
//! errors carry additional pass-through variants — see [`GammaError`] for an
//! example.
//!
//! [`SolverError`]: crate::error::SolverError
//! [`Normal`]: crate::Normal
//! [`GammaError`]: crate::GammaError
